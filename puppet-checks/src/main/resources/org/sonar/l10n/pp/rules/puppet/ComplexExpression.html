<p>
    The complexity of an expression is defined by the number of <code>or</code> and <code>and</code> conditions it
    contains. A single expression's complexity should not become too high to keep the code readable. Try to extract some
    sub-conditions to make the overall condition more understandable.
</p>
<p>
    This rule checks that the number of conditions is not greater than 3.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
if $var1 > 2 and $var2 > 3 or ($var3 > $var4 and $var1 < $var3) or $var5 > 4 { }  # Noncompliant: 4 'and' and 'or' conditions
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
$is_position_valid = $var3 > $var4 and $var1 < $var3
if $var1 > 2 and $var2 > 3 or $is_position_valid or $var5 > 4 { }
</pre>
